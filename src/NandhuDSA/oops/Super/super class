In Java, the super keyword is used to refer to the immediate parent class of the current class.
It has two main usages :

1.Accessing Parent Class Constructor:
super() can be used to call the constructor of the parent class from the child class constructor.

2.Accessing Parent Class Methods and Variables:
super can also be used to access methods or variables of the parent class that are overridden in the child class.

In summary, super is used in Java to interact with the parent class, whether by calling its
constructor or accessing its methods and variables.

• Data Hiding: Encapsulation hides the internal state of an object by making its variables private.

• Controlled Access: Public getter and setter methods are used to access and modify the private variables.

• Improved Security: Encapsulation protects an object’s data from unauthorized access and unwanted modifications.

• Flexibility: You can change the internal implementation of the class without affecting other classes that use it.

• Code Maintainability: Encapsulation helps in maintaining and modifying code easily, as changes are localized within the class.

• Validation: Encapsulation allows for validation or logic checks inside setter methods before setting a variable’s value.

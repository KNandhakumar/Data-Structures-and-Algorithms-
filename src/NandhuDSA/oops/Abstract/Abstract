• An abstract class in Java cannot be instantiated on its own; it is designed to be subclassed.

• Contains both abstract methods (without a body) and concrete methods (with a body).

• Provides a common base for subclasses, allowing them to share code.

• Enables subclasses to provide specific implementations for the abstract methods.
